              Recon Subsea developed an ROV, named “Varun”, which was capable of
              providing solutions to various tasks assigned by MATE Centre which
              was in collaboration with the Eastman Company in 2019. The ROV met
              all the requirements and necessities of the tasks. It was equipped
              with all the tools for accomplishing the given tasks. 21 members
              working in different domains were focused on developing the next
              gen ROV VARUN. The ROV’s design consisted of custom made PCBs,
              Thrusters, PVC pipes and mission specified custom handmade tools.
              The ROV was capable in maneuvering in 6 degrees of freedom. The
              payload tools were specifically designed for the mission. All of
              the electronic hardware, responsible for power management, vehicle
              movement and sensor data collection, was developed and designed
              from the ground up. The diligence and hard work of the team was
              awarded in the form of Best Design Award. The team came 2nd
              amongst many teams that were participating in the competition.

              It was the Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle developed by RECON
              SUBSEA for the 2018 MATE ROV COMPETITION. It satisfied the JET
              CITY’s request for an ROV which can successfully complete the
              given tasks in the stipulated time. 13 members from different
              domains worked tirelessly and hard over a period of 7 months to
              develop the next generation of Recon Subsea’s ROV “Rusty”. All the
              payload tools, which includes the main gripper, distance measuring
              tool, lift-bags, turning system and the levelling systems, were
              designed specifically to carry out the various tasks. Every
              hardware used in electronics cabinet was designed and fabricated
              from scratch. The GUI and the onboard software was developed by
              the Coding team. The team’s hard work was recognized at the
              competition as they bagged the 4th position at the MATE
              COMPETITION held in Indonesia.
